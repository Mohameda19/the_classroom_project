# the_classroom_project
This was my first project ever where I tried to build a web app which has a similar interface to that of the Google Classroom, but with the option
of submitting a good formatted source code that the instructor can evaluate and give points and suggestions to improve.

Since its my first project so the source code is not written very well, and hence will get archived.

### The frameworks and other necessary add ons I use in this project are:

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/)
- [PostgreSQL 12](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy/)  (for ORM support)
- [Flask-Migrate](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Migrate/) (to automate the migration when modifying the database)
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/intro/) (for templating)
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) 
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) (I am terrible with the frontend)
